# Hi, I'm accessdenied1 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a continuous student of IT/Cybersecurity, with the CompTIA PenTest+ certification and three years of experience as an IT Support Specialist. My expertise lies in ethical hacking, web application penetration testing, and managing Microsoft 365 and Azure environments. I love web app penetration testing and broken access controls. Oh, and RCEâ€”can't forget RCE. Enjoy!

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch via LinkedIn!
